1. Use scanner to fetch user name, age, phone number, and email, then encapsulate the data and portray it in the terminal

2. Use scanner to get the prices of the 5 different cars from the terminal and if the value of the car is equal or above 70000 RM, put them in the matrix of 2*2 which shows the value, "VIP", "2024", "pre-order" and if the value is below the 70000 put them in the matrix of 2*2 which shows the value, "Cheap", "old", "for sale" 

3. Create new code that the scanner get the value for the switch, if the user choose 1 he/she will enter stage that he/she needs to enter a value for 3*4 matrix, if the user choose 2 he/she will enter the stage that he/she need to enter values for 2*3 matrix. The result of the user must be shown regardless of the option. If the user enters anything else rather than 1 or 2, the output is going be invalid entry.
